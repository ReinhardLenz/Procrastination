# Procrastination
an "joke" online calculator, "Would I do something today that I could do tomorrow?" where user inputs parameters and online calculator gives a decision, whether it is necessary to do today, or if task can be delayed to tomorrow

Would I do something today that I could do tomorrow?

A responsible person has n pieces of things to do instead of lazing around. One could rake leaves, take newspapers to the paper bin, call mother or go to the store to get dog food. But no - there you are, couch potato. That's right. If one lets the leaves on the grass for another week, they'll rot. I suppose the same thing will happen to newspapers over time. Mum will call anyway. The dog's too fat anyway. The formula measures how hard it would take to do it now and how hard it would take to do it tomorrow, next week or next year. It also measures the psychological effects of both doing and leaving it.

K = Extent of the disaster if the mission is not carried out at all (1-10 for a "global emergency".

P = How many days can you postpone the task?

M = How likely is it that someone else will eventually get the job done? (1-10, where 1 = 0% and 10 = 100%.)

V= How angry will this "someone else" be with you after the job is done? (1-10)

E= How unpleasant is it to do the thing? (1-10, with 10 being "emptying an outdoor toilet in the sweltering heat."

L = Is it easier or harder to do the task by slacking off? If it gets easier, put a negative number between one and five in the equation. If it becomes more difficult, put a positive number between one and five in the equation.

H = Your history of procrastination from 0 to 10, where 10 is your "innate lazy-bum"

If T is bigger 1 it is best to start relatively immediately.
